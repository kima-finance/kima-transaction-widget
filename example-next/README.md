# Kima Transfer Widget Example (React + TypeScript + Next)

This template provides a minimal setup to get the Kima Transaction Widget working in Next with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Change directory to the root folder of the kima-transaction-widget. Then install the packages and run the server in dev mode for live changes.
```
cd kima-transaction-widget
npm install
npm run dev
```

Finally, change directory to the next example, install packages and run in dev mode.
```
cd example-next
npm install
npm run dev
```
